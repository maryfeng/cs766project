### Motivation
The quality of fruit is often associated with its outside appearance. The fruits sold at the grocery store are examined and judged for quality before shipping. Features such as color, size, and shape can affect the way that consumers select fruit and influence market value of produce. In order to make the highest profit, grocery stores sell the best looking fruits to appeal to customers. Fruit grading is an important step in selecting high quality fruit to bring from the farm or orchard to the consumer. Automating the fruit grading process is important for reducing the time and labor compared with the manual process conducted by humans. Computer vision-based techniques for fruit grading are often inexpensive and nondestructive which make them very competitive compared to manual inspection and machine physical inspection.

### Current State-of-the-art
Although there are some papers which discuss automated fruit grading techniques using computer vision, implementation of this is more rare in industry. One example is Ellips, which is a Dutch company that uses size and color to determine quality. Compac, a New Zealand-based company, uses software to grade cherries. Many agricultural companies still rely on humans to grade produce. There are some machines available for sorting and grading based on physical characteristics such as shape, weight, and how the fruit rolls. It appears many companies capable of automated visual fruit grading are located outside the United States or work specifically for one kind of fruit. 
There are several papers and companies that have implemented computer vision techniques with machine learning for orange grading. This includes classic machine learning algorithms involving some feature engineering, and more recently, deep learning methods for classification.
